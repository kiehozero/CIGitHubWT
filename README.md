# My very first webpage

Welcome! After many tears and tantrums, I've knocked up this incredibly basic website.

This website is written in basic [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and outlines the various programming languages that I'll hopefully be able to write this time next year!

One day I'll look back at the pain I had of linking Gitpod and Github and laugh at being so cocky to mess around and not follow the tutorial word for word.
